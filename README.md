## **What is DIM?**
**DIM.com** (also known as **D**igital **I**nterpersonal **M**arket) is a finance website aiming to break geographical limitations and bridge entrepreneurs from rural or remote areas with investors from all around the world, bringing greater opportunities for rural entrepreneurs to elevate their small businesses into more nationally, or globally recognised brands.

DIM was an idea born from the need to help rural entrepreneurs struggling with restricted access to capital and constraints from local markets. Due to these unforgivable circumstances, entrepreneurial ambition and local economic output are restrained, hindering the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth. 

DIM tackles this challenge by creating a platform that connects rural entrepreneurs with global investors, fostering business scaling and transformation, and unlocking impactful opportunities for entrepreneurs, investors, and the local communities that depend on these businesses for economic vitality.
